about
-----
The naming is a reference to a shortening of a technical term, that changed into jargon.
Anyways, here *h* is elevation and *t* denotes time and *d* is a differential operator.
Hence it should be read as elevation change over time.
Which is the information of interest, since elevation or kinematics causes geometric change that can be observed via satellite imagery.
